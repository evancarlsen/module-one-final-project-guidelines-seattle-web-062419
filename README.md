# MARS ROVER PHOTOS EXPLORER

# Made by Evan Carlses & Sean Hetzel

# Descrioption:
The Mars Rover Photos Explorer is an interactive CLI app that gets photos from the NASA api taken by the Mars rovers: Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit. The app runs in your terminal but opens the photos in your browser. The app has four main functions:

1) See a photo taken on Mars by specifying the rover and Earth date.

2) See a random photo taken by any of the rovers on any date in their mission history and guess the rover's name and the type of camera that was used to take the photo. 

3) See a random photo taken by any of the rovers on any date in their mission history and either save it to your favorites or see the next photo. 

4) See all your favorited photos.
